This skript if free to use and modify as you wish.

This is how to set it up and use it.

1. You will need to install node.js (don't worry, it is not a virus xd, it is widely used by many developers). You can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Then you will need to download the project. Go to the home page of this github project (https://github.com/captaincrazybro/party-games-afkscript) and click Code -> Download ZIP.
3. When it has downloaded you will need to unzip this and place the contents of the ziped file in a folder where you want this skript to run. 
4. Then go into the folder where your skript is and double clicke the setup.bat file.
5. The required node.js packages will be installed and then a file will be opened called .env whose contents will look like:

EMAIL= <br />
PASSWORD= <br />
APIKEY= <br />
UUID= <br />

After each '=' sign you will put the appropriate information. For email put your minecraft email, for password you put your minecraft password, for the apikey you will need to create a new api key on hypixel by executing the /api new command and copying the api key given, and for the uuid you will put your uuid (can be found at https://namemc.com by entering in your IGN). After you have done this, save the file.
6. Once you have done this, the setup process is complete. All you have to do now to start the skript is double click the start.bat file. And that's it! Note that whenever you want to play on your account you will have to exit the script by exiting the console window of the skript. To start it again, double click the start.bat file.

There is no way for me to see your username and password so you don't have to worry about that. There are no connections to outside storage systems that can save your username and password. It's just a simple skript to keep you afking party games.
